## About Dataset

The following dataset is extracted using an API and contains job data from LinkedIN about 10 common job roles in India.
The data can be used for a comprehensive analysis on application trends, peak posting times, popular job titles, company dynamics, geographical patterns, sector-specific insights, job freshness, company-specific behaviors, and predictive modeling. Predictive modeling can be used to anticipate job market dynamics. In summary, this dataset facilitates a thorough exploration of the job market, providing actionable insights for both job seekers and employers.

## Problem Statement
Job Market Trends: Analyze the trend of job postings over time. Are there certain months or seasons with more job postings? Are there any noticeable trends in specific industries or cities?

Popular Industries and Companies: Determine the most popular industries and companies hiring in India. Which sectors have the highest number of job postings? Which companies receive the most applications?

Skill Demand: Identify the most in-demand skills across different job titles and industries. Are there any emerging skills that are increasingly sought after by employers?

Geographical Analysis: Explore the distribution of job postings across cities and states in India. Which cities have the highest number of job opportunities? Are there any regional disparities in job availability?

Experience Level Requirements: Investigate the experience level required for various job roles. Do certain industries or companies prefer candidates with specific levels of experience? How does experience level correlate with salary or application count?

Contract and Work Arrangement Analysis: Compare the distribution of contract types (e.g., full-time, part-time, freelance) and work arrangements (e.g., remote, onsite) across different sectors and companies. Are there any trends or preferences?

Application Count Analysis: Examine the factors influencing the number of job applications received. Are there specific job titles, industries, or companies that attract more applicants? How does the duration since posting affect application count?

Recently Posted Jobs Analysis: Explore the characteristics of recently posted jobs. Do they differ from older job postings in terms of required skills, experience level, or contract type? How does the application count vary for recently posted jobs?

Job Descriptions Analysis: Analyze job descriptions to identify common keywords, skills, and qualifications. Can you detect any patterns or preferences in the language used to describe job requirements across different sectors?

Predictive Modeling: Build a predictive model to forecast future job market trends or predict the likelihood of a job receiving a high number of applications based on various features such as industry, location, and job description.

These problem statements should provide a comprehensive framework for your data analysis project, allowing you to derive valuable insights into the job market dynamics in India.
